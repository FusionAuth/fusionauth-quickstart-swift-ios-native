# Quickstart: iOS App with FusionAuth Swift SDK

This repository contains an iOS app extracted from the FusionAuth iOS SDK that works with a locally running instance of [FusionAuth](https://fusionauth.io/), the authentication and authorization platform.

<!--
this and following tags, and the corresponding end tag, are used to delineate what is pulled into the FusionAuth docs site (the client libraries pages). Don't remove unless you also change the docs site.

Please also use ``` instead of indenting for code blocks. The backticks are translated correctly to adoc format.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
<!--
tag::forDocSitePrerequisites[]
-->
You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/): The official IDE for iOS helps you develop and install the necessary tools to set it up.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com): The quickest way to stand up FusionAuth. Ensure you also have [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.
  - (Alternatively, you can [Install FusionAuth Manually](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/)).
<!--

### FusionAuth Installation via Docker
<!--
tag::forDocSiteDocker[]
-->
The root of this project directory _(next to this README)_ are two files: [a Docker compose file](./docker-compose.yml) and an [environment variables configuration file](./.env). Assuming you have Docker installed on your machine, you can stand up FusionAuth up on your machine with:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The FusionAuth configuration files also make use of a unique feature of FusionAuth, called [Kickstart](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/kickstart): when FusionAuth comes up for the first time, it will look at the [Kickstart file](kickstart/kickstart.json) and mimic API calls to configure FusionAuth for use when it is first run. 

> **NOTE**: If you ever want to reset the FusionAuth system, delete the volumes created by Docker Compose by executing `docker compose down -v`. 

FusionAuth will be initially configured with these settings:
* Your client Id is: `21e13847-4f30-4477-a2d9-33c3a80bd15a`
* Your `Example Android App` test user `richard@example.com` and your password is `password`.
* Your FusionAuth admin username is `admin@example.com` and your password is `password`.
* Your fusionAuthBaseUrl to access FusionAuth is `http://localhost:9011/`

You can log into the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin) and look around if you want, but with Docker/Kickstart you don't need to.

### Running the Android App
<!--
tag::forDocSiteRun[]
-->
This iOS Quickstart is fully functional and can be used without any modifications:

- Open this project's `complete-application` folder in [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).
- Either connect an iPhone or create an iPhone Simulator to run the app.

And there are additional [testing instructions](TESTING.md) available for different scenarios.

## Further Information

Please follow the following sections for further information about the Quickstart and FusionAuth Swift SDK.

### Quickstart

See the [FusionAuth Swift iOS Quickstart](https://fusionauth.io/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-swift-ios-native/) for a full tutorial on using FusionAuth and iOS.

### Documentation FusionAuth Android SDK

See the [FusionAuth Swift SDK Documentation](https://fusionauth.io/docs/sdks/swift-sdk) for an overview to the SDK. Or see the latest [Full library documentation](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-swift-sdk/tree/main/Documentation/Reference) for the complete documentation of the SDK.

### Automated End 2 End Testing

While developing the iOS SDK we made use of Automated End 2 End Testing within the SwiftTests. This is something useful during App development and we moved the test as well into the quickstart and further documented our testing implementation [here](TESTING.md).

<!--
Maintainer info on how to create the example App manually:

The example App is a copy from https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-swift-sdk/tree/main/Samples/Quickstart by:

1. Copy the Samples/Quickstart folder in to the complete-application folder
2. edit the complete-application/fusionauth-quickstart-swift-ios-native.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj file, removing the Packages and sdk references. 
3. open the project and add the sdk dependency by adding the latest release from https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-swift-sdk/
5. update the docker-compose.yml file to use the latest version used by the sdk
